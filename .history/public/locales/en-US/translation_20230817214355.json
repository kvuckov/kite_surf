You fly the kite to the front of the wind window in your direction of travel (like reefing a mainsail in), edge your board to create a 'keel', and steer with your feet to create a 'rudder'. Kitesurfers are actually classified as sailing vessels."},

Please note that if you are buying a second hand kite, make sure that the kite you are buying is less than 4 years old. Every year there are improvements in the safety of kites - by buying a relatively recent kite you will keep yourself safe. Never be tempted into buying a cheap old kite if you are a beginner - they are cheap for a reason and can be dangerous."},

Different kites have different launching, landing, and water relaunching techniques. Your vendor should be able to provide you with the appropriate instructions."}
